# **COVID-19 Pandemic Analysis in East Africa**  

## **Overview**  
This report presents an **in-depth analysis** of COVID-19 trends in **Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania**, using data from **Our World in Data (OWID)**. The study examines **infection rates, vaccination uptake, and mortality trends** to understand how each country managed the pandemic.  

## **Tools Used for Analysis**  
The analysis leveraged **Python libraries** to process and visualize the data:  
- **Pandas** for data manipulation.  
- **Matplotlib** for static trend visualizations.  
- **Plotly Express** for interactive visualizations, particularly in worldwide case comparisons.  

## **Key Insights**  

### **Total COVID-19 Cases Over Time**  
- **Kenya recorded the highest total cases (~350,000)**, likely due to **wider transmission, increased testing**, or improved reporting.  
- **Uganda followed (~150,000 cases),** suggesting **moderate transmission and intervention effectiveness**.  
- **Tanzania reported the lowest cases (~50,000),** possibly due to **limited testing or different reporting approaches**.  
- Case numbers **continued rising**, showing ongoing waves influenced by **variants, containment policies, and population behavior**.  

### **Total COVID-19 Deaths Over Time**  
- **Kenya reported the highest deaths (~5,000),** potentially due to **overwhelmed healthcare facilities and sustained outbreaks**.  
- **Uganda recorded over 3,000 deaths**, indicating **effective containment but significant losses**.  
- **Tanzania’s deaths remained below 1,000**, possibly reflecting **alternative reporting methods or different intervention strategies**.  

### **Daily New COVID-19 Cases**  
- **Kenya experienced multiple waves**, with peaks reaching **around 5,000 daily cases**.  
- **Uganda saw the highest single-day peak (~20,000 cases),** possibly due to **rapid spread or delayed reporting**.  
- **Tanzania’s case numbers remained relatively flat**, with one **major spike** indicating **either an outbreak or updated reporting**.  

### **Vaccination Rollout in East Africa**  
- **Kenya had the lowest vaccination rate**, with **73.2% of its population unvaccinated**, highlighting **accessibility and hesitancy challenges**.  
- **Uganda showed moderate vaccine uptake (42.4% vaccinated).**  
- **Tanzania led in vaccination, with 52.6% of its population immunized,** possibly due to **strong public health initiatives**.  
- **By mid-2023, Tanzania surpassed Kenya and Uganda in cumulative vaccinations**, suggesting **late-stage efforts to improve coverage**.  

## **Conclusion**  
The report highlights **significant disparities** in **COVID-19 case numbers, vaccination rates, and response strategies** across East Africa. Findings emphasize the **urgent need for proactive health measures, improved data transparency, and stronger pandemic preparedness**. Moving forward, governments should **strengthen healthcare infrastructure, promote vaccination, and refine crisis response strategies** to ensure resilience in future health emergencies.
